# EDA-using-Matplotlib
![How to Build the Ultimate Sales Process in 6 Steps (2023)](https://i0.wp.com/emailanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/100-Sales-Statistics-to-Help-Boost-Your-Sales-in-2020-1080x675.jpg)
In this project I have taken the most famous Sales Dataset and tried to do an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to and visualize them.

**P.S. I'll only be using a visualization library called ==Matplotlib== in this workbook to visualize the plots and no other library. Feel free to check my other repositories to explore other different visualization libraries.**

## About Sales Dataset
![Communication Networks: How is Information Transmitted? | HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/sites/default/files/styles/knowledge_articles_full/public/2018-11/Communication-Networks-How-is-Information-Transmitted_knowledge_standard.jpg?itok=R1KwNk1H)
The data has following features and variables:

-   **Country:** This variable represents the country where the sale occurred. It is a categorical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable. Depending on the scope of the dataset, the values of this variable may represent countries around the world, regions within a single country, or some other subset of locations.
    
-   **Product:** This variable represents the product that was sold in each transaction. Like the Country variable, it is a categorical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable. The values of this variable may represent specific products or categories of products.
    
-   **Units Sold:** This variable represents the number of units of the product that were sold in each transaction. It is a numerical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable.
    
-   **Manufacturing Price:** This variable represents the cost of manufacturing each unit of the product. It is a numerical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable. This variable is important for calculating the cost of goods sold and the resulting profit for each transaction.
    
-   **Sale Price:** This variable represents the price at which each unit of the product was sold. It is a numerical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable.
    
-   **Gross Sales:** This variable represents the total sales revenue generated by each transaction, before any discounts are applied. It is a numerical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable. Gross sales can be calculated by multiplying the Units Sold by the Sale Price.
    
-   **Discounts:** This variable represents any discounts that were applied to the transaction. It is a numerical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable. Discounts are subtracted from Gross Sales to calculate the Net Sales.
    
-   **Sales:** This variable represents the net sales revenue generated by each transaction, after any discounts are applied. It is a numerical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable. Net sales can be calculated by subtracting Discounts from Gross Sales.
    
-   **COGS:** This variable represents the cost of goods sold for each transaction. It is a numerical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable. COGS can be calculated by multiplying Units Sold by the Manufacturing Price.
    
-   **Profit:** This variable represents the profit generated by each transaction. It is a numerical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable. Profit can be calculated by subtracting COGS and Discounts from Gross Sales.
    
-   **Date:** This variable represents the date on which each transaction occurred. It is a date variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable.
    
-   **Month Name:** This variable represents the month in which each transaction occurred. It is a categorical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable.
    
-   **Year:** This variable represents the year in which each transaction occurred. It is a numerical variable, and each observation in the dataset will have a corresponding value for this variable.
## We will structure the code as follows

1.  Loading the data
    
2.  Preparing the data
    
3.  Exploratory Data Analysis
    
## These are some of the insights

- Quantity of units sold is very balanced but most of the Unit sold is in the category is in the range of 1000 to 1100.
- Most of the sales which takes place are skewed at the lower prices.
- The sales taking place are ranging from 0 to 2000000 but a considerable amount of the sales are of 14000000.
- Most of the products that are being produced lies in only 3 ranges 0-50, 100-150, 200-250
- Most of the sales were made in the year 2020 followed by 2019 and 2018.
- The company can clearly see that every year they are increasing their sales by around 20%.
- The top 3 products in the current market are "Vermont" followed by "Mandarin" and "Burlington"
- The most Profitable product in the current market is not the highest selling product which is "Vermont" instead it is the 3rd most selling product that is "Burlington".
- Though we can see that "Burlington" is the most profitable we can see that it is followed by "Luxe" and "Kensington", which is quiet weird because the top 2 most selling products in the market are not even in the top 3 most profitable products.
- The sales in the top 3 countries which are "Brazil", "Japan" and "United Kingdom"
- "October" is the best month for the company as it is generating most sales and profits in the respective month.
- Apart from "October" we can also see that after october most sales are done in "December", but when it comes to the profits, after "October" the most profitable month is not "December" instead it's "September" followed by "June", "November" and then comes "December".
- There is a very high positive coorelation between Profit and Sales, and a low coorelation between Profit and Year
- There is a very high positive coorelation between Discount and COGS, which means that if the COGS increases there is an 81% chance that Discount will also increase.
## That's it
These were all the insights that i came up with, but there are numerous and plenty more insights that you can find by exploring the workbook, feel free to look at the `ipnyb` file to explore more.
